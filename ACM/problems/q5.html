<h1>Question 5 - Herding Frosh</h1>

One day, a lawn in the centre of campus became infested with Frosh.  In
an effort to beautify the campus, one of our illustrious senior classmen
decided to round them up using a length of pink silk.  Your job is to
compute how much silk was required to complete the task.
<p>
The senior classman tied the silk to a telephone post, and walked
around the perimeter of the area containing the Frosh, drawing the silk
taught so as to encircle all of them.  He then returned to the
telephone post.  The senior classman used the minimum amount of silk
necessary to encircle all the frosh plus one extra
metre at each end to tie it.
<p>
You may assume that the telephone post is at coordinates (0,0), where the
first dimension is North/South and the second dimension is East/West.  The
coordinates of the Frosh are given in metres relative to the post.  There
are no more than 256 Frosh.
<p>
The input consists of a line specifying the number of Frosh, followed
by one line per Frosh with two real numbers indicating his or her position.
The output consists of a single number - the length of silk in metres,
to two decimal places.
